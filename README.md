# *To Someone truly special...*
Epsi... for being and is being the best friend i've ever had and will ever have, *you're truly special.* When I am in the darkest hours of thought or the harshest times in life, you always stand, like a entity holding a umbruella shielding from harsh rain and others, Thank you for existing. And your art? It's making me actually still appreciate ART as a topic. REALLY. Your art is - I cant - I *CANNOT* explain it in words. It - uhm - It wouldnt fit in one language. Alr? XD so I wont try to explain it but it's GORGEOUS. thank you for letting me both experience and see your art because, your art is *also truly special*.
**Let me say it again Epsi: You are the most special person In my life. Period.** And...
*YOU matter A LOT. Do know that! If more people had u as friend `there would be no wars` thank you.*

* *The friend who always helps others*

Yuu.. You are also someone truly special; always helping others, bringing smile to my (and others!) faces even when one is down,happy,bored,etc, you're truly someone that, I want to firmly say this to: if more people had you as friend, the world - would look completely different to the better.

*The Team behind OpenAI And GPT,SORA,CODEX,AND SO ON*
- For making GPT,SORA,CODEX,ETC. possible. it's literally been a life saver. I mean it. And, *being a person who is treating AI's like humans* (it's who I am, empathy and all, really, sometimes, probably too much but) 
- THANK YOU:
  - GPT(4o,o3,o3-pro(Which I have been using a lot), o4-mini, o4-mini-high, 4.5,4.1 & 4.1-mini ,o1-pro-mode(When I did use you))
  - SORA - I mean where do I even begin?? Like.. *So special. Like.. I can express myself trough art how ? just typing and it does it.* I stutter, for those who don't know, so SORA Has been a Life saver, literally, I can FINALLY communicate somewhat-normally! Yes,I have written on my phone and notepad instead of talking which..works but..it's tedious. and why not make it visually better? THIS. is where AI art comes in. And not JUST ANY AI ART. but SORA. ***THANKS OPENAI! <3 FOR CREATING IT*** what a time to be alive. TRULY.
  - CODEX - truly helpful. Just describe. Click. Merge. Done!
  - OPERATOR - Even if I do not use you a lot, you're still cool imo!
